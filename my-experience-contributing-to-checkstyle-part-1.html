            <p>
                In this article, I will be sharing <b>my experience</b> so far contributing to the <b>CheckStyle</b> Project.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 1rem 0rem;">
                I will be talking a little bit <em>about what I have learned + what I am working on right now</em> and <b>how I started getting involved in the community</b>. I will also be sharing <em>how you can get involved</em> and <em>start contributing to the Project</em>.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 2rem 0rem;">
                First of all, let me introduce you to the <b>CheckStyle</b> Project, <em>what is it all about, how it works, and what technology stack is being used</em> in the Project.
            </p>
            <h2>Intro to the CheckStyle Open Source tool</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task.
                    </em>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="margin: 2rem 0rem;">
                <b>Checkstyle</b> is also highly configurable and can be used to support any coding style(for Java).
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that style of code becomes <em>significantly important</em> when it comes to working on a team project.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Checkstyle</b> helps <b>maintain consistent</b> and <b>proper code style</b> for <em>projects build in Java</em> by providing different <b>Checks</b> for <em>layout, code formatting, class design, method design, type checking</em>. So, if the source code is <em>not following a proper style or has incorrect syntax</em>, then this tool shows <b>violations</b> on <b>specific lines in those files</b> which you can then easily rectify.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can explore the project repository on <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle"><b>Github</b></a>. You can check out the documentation of the Project <a href="https://checkstyle.org/index.html"><b>here</b></a> to learn more about these checks.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Tech Stack
            </h2>
            <p>
                Checkstyle is mainly built in <b>Java</b> and it uses <b>Maven/Gradle</b> as a <b>build tool</b>, <b>JUnit framework</b> for <b>testing</b>, <b>ANTLR</b> for <b>grammar</b>, and <b>parsing of Java code as AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)</b>, and many other <em>tools/utilities</em> that make up this amazing tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can know more about the <em>Project dependencies</em> <a href="https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/dependencies.html"><b>here</b></a>.

            <h2>
                My Open Source Journey
            </h2>
            <p>
                If I talk about <b>my Open Source journey</b>, <em>I started exploring Open Source a few months back</em> and <em>I made a few contributions by participating in a University level</em> <b>Open Source program</b>(was one of the top 50 contributors) and I really started enjoying it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized that I can literally learn a lot of different technologies by contributing and get hands-on experience too!!
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am also participating in <a href="https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/"><b>Girlscript Summer Of Code 2021</b></a> which is a 3-month <em>Open Source Program</em> held in India to promote Open Source culture amongst young programmers. I am contributing to different projects related to <em>web development in Python</em> and some projects using <b>Java</b>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                My Experience and Learnings
            </h2>
            <img src="assets/blog-images/blog-3/img-1.jpg">
            <p>
                I came to know about the Checkstyle project just a few months back, while looking for <em>organizations</em> on the <b>GSoC 2020</b>(Google Summer Of Code) website. I was mostly looking for <em>projects/organizations using Java</em> since I had been learning Java and was more comfortable with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found the <b>Checkstyle organization’s website</b> and I really loved the idea of this project and how it can a <em>very useful tool</em> while <b>working on projects in a team</b> since it becomes really <b>easy to maintain code quality</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I soon <em>started exploring this tool</em> and started <em>getting involved</em> in the <b>community’s mailing list</b> and <b>Gitter channel</b>(You can find these on the official GSoC website <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5553288004501504/"><b>here</b></a>). I also started contributing to <em>beginner-friendly issues</em>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                My First Contribution
            </h2>
            <p>
                Talking about <b>my first contribution</b>, it was to update the example of <b>AST</b>(<em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em>) in the Javadoc documentation.
                <em>Don’t worry, it might seem a little overwhelming at first, but you will get a little familiarized with the codebase!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked on a couple of these issues and it helped me <b>understand how to use CheckStyle</b> on any project from the CLI. It helped me <b>understand the Project structure</b> and I also <b>learned about ASTs</b>(Abstract Syntax Tree).
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        An <b>AST</b> is a tree representation of the syntax of the source code in a programming language. You can learn more about them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><b>here</b></a>.
                    </em>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="margin: 2rem 0rem;">
                Next, I went a level-up and <em>worked on some of the GSoC second issues</em>.
                Now, <b>Checkstyle</b> is a <b>very well-tested tool</b> with <b>Unit Tests, <a href="https://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators/">pitests</a>, regression checking</b> written for each check and <b>CI tests</b> (used to <em>analyze its source code by running Checkstyle itself</em>!).
            </p>
            <p>
                As I had mentioned previously, <b>CheckStyle</b> has <em>different checks implemented (like indentation, header, import, block checks, type checks, etc) for checking the source code(written in Java) of any project</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, for this issue, I had to <em>update a specific Test for a check</em> to have it use <b>unique input files</b>(<em>these files are used to test each of the check’s functionality</em>) for every method in the Test.
            </p>
            <h2>What I learned after resolving these issues</h2>
            <p>
                By resolving this issue, I <b>learned a little bit about Unit testing</b> and <b>TDD using the JUnit framework</b>.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        I learned that in <b>TDD</b>, we write tests to test the functionality of code(for eg:- an instance method) and compare the expected and actual cases of output to determine whether the code does what it should do in the first place.
                    </em>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="margin: 1rem 0rem;">
                I also <em>learned about different</em> <b>properties</b> and <b>configurations</b> based on which the checks actually verify source code and <b>report violations</b>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What am I working on right now/current learnings?</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, I have started <b>working on different variety of issues</b> and <b>getting a little deeper understanding of this tool</b>, <b>the different checks that Checkstyle provides</b>, and also <b>how to properly test your code for different edge cases</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently <em>learning about the different tools</em> used in the Project like <a href="https://t.co/9lN3BgkYUa?amp=1"><b>XPATH</b></a>(syntax used to navigate <b>XML elements/nodes</b>), <a href="https://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators/"><b>pitests</b></a>, <b>Unit testing</b> with <b>JUnit</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, <b>pitests</b> are basically <b>mutation tests</b> <em>used to check how good the test coverage is</em>, and it <em>creates mutations in the code</em> (deliberately break the code).
            </p>
            <p>
                By doing this, we ensure <em>that all tests cover our code completely</em> and <em>that certain redundant cases could be removed</em> <b>to keep the source code clean and precise</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This might seem a little overwhelming but trust me it gets very interesting as you deeply explore the project. I am also learning about <b>how I could configure this tool and use it in my own projects</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am <em>looking to get a deeper understanding</em> of what <b>each check does</b>, <b>understand their code</b>, and <b>resolve bugs</b> related to specific checks(<em>like indentation, Javadoc, block checks, etc</em>). I will also be looking to <em>add tests while resolving these bugs</em>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                How you can get involved and start contributing to Checkstyle?
            </h2>
            <ol id="order-list">
                <li>
                    Before getting started, you should first <b>set up your development environment</b> and <b>clone the Project locally</b>. You can follow this <a href="https://checkstyle.org/beginning_development.html"><b>documentation</b></a>. You can clone the project from the <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle"><b>Github repository</b></a>. Also,<b> join the community channel on Gitter</b> and <b>the mailing list</b>, as you can <b>ask for help if you face issues</b> while contributing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>After you set up the project</b>, I would <b>suggest you either install the jar file for Checkstyle</b> from <a href="https://checkstyle.org/cmdline.html#Download_and_Run"><b>here</b></a> or you can <b>install the Checkstyle extension for your IDE</b>(check <a href="https://checkstyle.org/index.html#Related_Tools_Active_Tools"><b>this</b></a> out).
                    <b>If you install the jar file</b> then you can <em>play around</em> with this Project using the <b>CLI</b>(<em>which is easier</em>) or if you <b>installed the IDE extension</b> then you can use it in your IDE.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read the <a href="https://checkstyle.org/index.html"><b>documentation</b></a>(<em>to know more about the tool and also you can get answers to your questions/doubts there most of the time</em>) and go through some <b>beginner-friendly issues</b> by filtering issues according to issue labels on Github.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Keep contributing</b> and <b>exploring the tool</b> by picking up different types of issues.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                <b>Checkstyle</b> has a number of <b>CI tests</b> that <b>run tests</b> on your <b>PR branch</b>. So, <em>if some of these tests fail</em>, you can have a <b>look at the logs</b> that are generated or you can also <b>ask for help</b> on the <b>Gitter channel</b>.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0rem;">
                Another thing that I would suggest is to <em>look up similar issues to what you are working on</em> and have a <em>look at the PRs for those issues</em>. This would <em>help you a lot to understand</em> what you <b>have to do in those issues</b>. The <em>mentors/maintainers</em> of the organization are <em>super helpful</em> and <em>supportive</em> and have been maintaining this Project actively.
